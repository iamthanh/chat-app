Hello there,

Here's a really simple chat app which allows you to select chatrooms and send messages

1) First, the user is asked for a username to be use in the chat system
2) Then, the user is taken to the main chatapp
3) On the left, the user can select available chatrooms to join
4) On the right will be the main messages window
5) At the bottom, there is the input field to send messages

The frontend is put together using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Let's get started

First, let's get the backend started with node, run this to make sure you have all of the node modules needed:
### `npm install` 

Then, let's do the same for the frontend client
### `cd client && npm install`

Once that is done, fire up the backend and front-end
### For backend, `npm start` from the root

This will use nodemon to start the nodejs server, nodemon will auto restart when changes are made

### For frontend, `npm start`

## Note
The backend will open up on http://localhost:8080/
while, the frontend runs from http://localhost:3000/
